#  The VBA of Wall Street

Background
I will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 


Files


I tested Data while developing my scripts.


Stock Data - I ran my scripts on this data to generate the final report.



Stock Market Analyst


Instructions


I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:


The ticker symbol.


Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


The total stock volume of the stock.

Conditional formatting that highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red.


The solution also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:



I make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.


Other Considerations:


I used the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing the code. This data set is smaller and will allow testing faster. Code runs on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.


I made sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with a click of a button.
